# NextStep 🚀

NextStep is a productivity app that helps users decide **what to do next** by giving one clear, actionable step based on their goals and available time.

Most people aren’t lazy — they’re stuck.  
NextStep removes decision paralysis by suggesting **one meaningful next action** instead of overwhelming task lists.
