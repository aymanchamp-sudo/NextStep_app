# NextStep 🚀

NextStep is a productivity app that helps users decide **what to do next** by giving one clear, actionable step based on their goals and available time.

Most people aren’t lazy — they’re stuck.  
NextStep removes decision paralysis by suggesting **one meaningful next action** instead of overwhelming task lists.

🧠 Idea Behind the App

Many productivity apps fail because they overwhelm users with too many choices.

NextStep was built to solve this problem by focusing on decision simplicity — helping users immediately know what to work on next, based on their real-life constraints.

This approach prioritizes progress over perfection.
